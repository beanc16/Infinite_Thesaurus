# Infinite Thesaurus
Search for synonyms and antonyms for any word, or multiple words at once, with just a few clicks.

## Why is the thesaurus "infinite"?
Have you ever been writing a story or essay and wanted a different way of saying a word? You probably used a thesaurus to find synonyms of a word. Then synonyms of those synonyms, then synonyms of those synonyms, and so on. Wouldn't it be much easier if you could get synonyms of multiple words at once to make searching faster? I thought so too. Thus, the Infinite Thesaurus was born.

## What Does It Do?
The Infinite Thesaurus allows you to search for a word's synonyms or antonyms like any other online thesaurus. After that, you select one or more words from your initial search and get even more synonyms or antonyms from them. Repeat this process until you've found a word you're satisfied with, and savor the time you saved by searching multiple words at once.
